A power generating floor system utilizes piezoelectric sensors embedded within its structure to harness energy from mechanical stress caused by foot traffic. When people walk or move on the floor, the pressure exerted on the piezoelectric sensors generates electricity. This harvested energy can be stored in a battery or used directly to power low-power electronic devices.
